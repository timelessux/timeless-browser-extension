Many Ethereum applications have already built subgraphs and use them today including: Audius, Uniswap, Opyn, ENS, DAOstack, Synthetix, Moloch and more.\n\nNOTE: The Graph token contract on Arbitrum has migrated from old contract (https://arbiscan.io/address/0x23a941036ae778ac51ab04cea08ed6e2fe103614) to new contract (https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9623063377ad1b27544c965ccd7342f7ea7e88c7).

Since PAXG represents physical gold, its value is tied directly to the real-time market value of that physical gold. PAXG gives customers the benefits of actual physical ownership of specific gold bars with the speed and mobility of a digital asset. Customers are able to have fractional ownership of physical bars. On the Paxos platform, customers can convert their tokens to allocated gold, unallocated gold, or fiat currency (and vice versa) quickly and efficiently, reducing their exposure to settlement risk. PAXG is also available for trading on Paxos’ itBit exchange. PAXG will also be available on other crypto-asset exchanges, wallets, lending platforms and elsewhere within the crypto ecosystem.  At any time, PAXG holders can lookup the serial number, value and physical characteristics of their vaulted gold just by entering their Ethereum wallet address on the PAXG lookup tool on Paxos.com/paxgold.",

The platform allows anyone to write on their Request Ledger and create a payment request. The payment request is then detected by the recipient (via a wallet or via a financial application) monitoring the network. The request is paid instantaneously post-application of required trade laws, taxes and advanced payment terms.\n\nTo prevent malicious use, the network charges a miner fee when a new payment is created. The collected fees are stored on an Ethereum smart contract and burned periodically to lower the amount of REQ tokens in existence. While the tokens are burnt on the Ethereum mainnet, Request uses xDai Stable Chain to process transaction by locking them in a contract before being moved back to Etherum mainet for burning.",

According to core developer SKALE Labs, SKALE chains can run full-state smart contracts, support decentralized storage, execute rollup contracts (a layer-2 scaling solution), and run machine learning algorithms using the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).
