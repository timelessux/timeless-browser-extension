FTM, the project's native token, is used for payments, governance, and ongoing block rewards sent to validators and delegators who stake FTM. The network's independent consensus layer, called Lachesis, features a novel consensus mechanism developed by the Fantom Foundation dubbed the \"Lachesis Protocol.\" Lachesis can provide security to multiple other layers, the first of which is Fantom's EVM-compatible smart contract chain called Opera. The project's goal is to host an ecosystem of execution layers while enabling them to feature fast and cost-efficient transactions derived from the benefits of the proprietary Lachesis Protocol.",

    "about": "Frax Finance is a fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol that uses both collateralization and algorithmic processes to create its decentralized stablecoin, FRAX. The collateral ratio, which is the ratio of collateral needed to back $1 of FRAX, varies with time and is solely determined by market forces. Only stablecoins are currently accepted as collateral by the protocol, with plans to accept more volatile collateral like wrapped BTC as the protocol is increasingly adopted",

    "about": "Magic Internet Money (MIM) is a USD soft-pegged stablecoin minted by the Abracadabra.money decentralized platform. Abracadabra uses interest-bearing tokens as collateral to mint MIM. Interest-bearing tokens able to be used as of February 2022 as collateral include liquidity provider (LP) tokens from Convex, Curve, Yearn, among others. The loan liquidation process on Abracadabra differs from other stablecoin/lending protocols like MakerDAO, in that each collateralized debt position (CDP) and its liquidation price is unique. Should the liquidation price for any specific CDP be crossed, a liquidator can purhcase the position by paying off the outstanding MIM.",
